# SSPOP (Sparse Sensor Placement Optimization for Prediction)
This repository contains code and data to replicate some of the results and figures from our paper titled "Artificial Hair Sensor Placement Optimization on Airfoils for Angle of Attack Prediction" presented at the 2023 AIAA SciTech conference in Orlando, FL.

Our algorithm and application are new but were inspired by the groundbreaking SSPOC and SSPOR algorithms by Brunton, Brunton, Manohar, Kutz, and Proctor from the University of Washington. 

Refer to their papers from 2016: https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2018.2810460 and 2018: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1701.07569 for detailed information about these algorithms.
